# Dhruv Sharma – Data Science & Fraud Analytics Hub  

Welcome to my all-in-one data science repository — a living notebook of everything I’ve learned, built, and explored in analytics, fraud detection, and data storytelling.

##  About This Repository  

This repo is my **complete knowledge base** — covering SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy), Machine Learning, and Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau).  
It includes:
- Notes & concepts – from data cleaning to A/B testing.
- Real-world projects – end-to-end analytics, modeling, dashboards.
- Learning journals – daily reflections and takeaways.
- Utilities – helper functions and SQL templates I reuse often.
