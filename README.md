# ðŸ§© Dhruv Sharma â€“ Data Science & Fraud Analytics Hub  

Welcome to my all-in-one data science repository â€” a living notebook of everything Iâ€™ve learned, built, and explored in analytics, fraud detection, and data storytelling.

##  About This Repository  

This repo is my **complete knowledge base** â€” covering SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy), Machine Learning, and Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau).  
It includes:
- Notes & concepts â€“ from data cleaning to A/B testing.
- Real-world projects â€“ end-to-end analytics, modeling, dashboards.
- Learning journals â€“ daily reflections and takeaways.
- Utilities â€“ helper functions and SQL templates I reuse often.
